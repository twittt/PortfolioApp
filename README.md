# My Portfolio App

I made this app to provide a little more information about me, my skills, and my interests. Since I work primarily in iOS development, it seemed only apt to showcase my personality in the format I know best. 

## Installation

You can clone the repo and launch the app using XCode on you local machine, or reach out to me for the TestFlight link.
